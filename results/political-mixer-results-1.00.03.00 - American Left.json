The ratings approximate an average position across this spectrum rather than any single party, politician, or organization. Because the category is internally diverse and often contested, many axis values are moderate and assigned with only medium confidence.

This classification reflects a broad and internally diverse movement rather than a monolithic ideology, which explains moderate-to-low gain scores across most axes due to significant variance in positions among constituent groups. The assessment prioritizes widely shared tendencies while acknowledging substantial disagreement within the Left on economic models, institutional trust, and strategic priorities.",
